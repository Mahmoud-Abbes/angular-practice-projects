# Dynamic Filter List App

Small Angular project to practice custom pipes and list filtering.

## Learned

- Creating custom pipes in Angular
- Generating pipes using Angular CLI
- Understanding pipe structure (PipeTransform, value, args, return type)
- Filtering arrays using JavaScript .filter()
- Implementing case-insensitive search
- Using custom pipes inside template loops (*ngFor)

## Note

The pipe used to filter the list is implemented only for learning purposes.  
In real-world Angular applications, list filtering should generally be handled in components or services instead of pipes.
